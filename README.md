# Control_chart

In this mini project I wrote a function that generates an x-bar_s control chart. The chart is made based on an array with random values that are normally distributed. The array is a simulation of a process control - number of rows is number of measurements that will be displayed on the chart, and number of columns is a size of a subgroup in evey measurement. The array is generated by the function and all the parameters (mean, standard deviation, array size) are definied by the user. x_bar chart shows means of every measurements and s chart standard deviation of every measurements.

# Example

Here is the chart that funciton generated for N(
